# CS571-F25 HW10: BadgerChat (Voice!)

Welcome back to our final installment of BadgerChat! For this assignment, you will re-implement BadgerChat as *a chat application*. By completing this class, you will have developed a web, mobile, and chat interface for BadgerChat! 🥳🎉 

## Setup

You will complete a chat agent using [Wit.AI](https://wit.ai/).

The starter code provided to you was generated using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/). Furthermore, [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap) and [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap) have already been installed. In this directory, simply run...

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then, in a browser, open `localhost:5173`. You should *not* open index.html in a browser; React works differently than traditional web programming! When you save your changes, they appear in the browser automatically. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to do your development work.

## API Notes

All routes are relative to `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/f25/hw10/`

 - **This API shares the same database as HW6 and HW9.**
 - **This API only supports getting chatrooms and messages; it does not support authentication.**
 - **This API does NOT paginate messages *nor* is a chatroom name required.**
   - Instead, a `chatroom` and max `num` of posts (up to 10) may *optionally* be specified.

See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for full details.

| Method | URL | Purpose | Return Codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET`| `/chatrooms` | Get all chatrooms. | 200, 304 |
| `GET` | `/messages?chatroom=NAME&num=NUM`| Get latest `NUM` messages for specified chatroom. | 200, 400, 404 |


## Fall 2025 Special Note

As of October 22nd, [Wit.AI does not seem to be training any new agents](https://github.com/wit-ai/wit/issues/2806) with no end in sight. Therefore, a WitAI Access Token is given for you in `TextApp.jsx` with a pre-trained agent! You can activate the following intents by using the utterances below...

`get_help`
 - help
 - get help
 - what can I do

`get_chatrooms`
 - chatrooms
 - what chatrooms are there
 - what chatrooms can I use

`get_messages`
 - messages
 - give me the 4 latest posts
 - what are the 3 latest posts in Bascom Hill Hangout

 The `badgerchat_witai.zip` is attached for your reference for specifics about the utterances, intents, and entities used.

## BadgerMart

### 1. `get_help`

In your Wit.AI agent, train your agent to understand a `get_help` intent. Utterances along the lines of "help", "get help", or "what can I do" should trigger this intent. In response, the agent should inform the user of which actions it supports.

### 2. `get_chatrooms`

In your Wit.AI agent, train your agent to understand a `get_chatrooms` intent. Utterances along the lines of "chatrooms", "what chatrooms are there", or "what chatrooms can I use" should trigger this intent.

Then, when this intent is triggered, the agent should respond with the full list of chatrooms. You *must* get this data by fetching from the API; you may *not* hardcode the chatroom names.

### 3. `get_messages`

In your Wit.AI agent, train your agent to understand a `get_messages` intent. Utterances along the lines of "messages", "give me the 4 latest posts", or "what are the 3 latest posts in Bascom Hill Hangout" should trigger this intent.

Then, when this intent is triggered, the agent should respond with the latest X messages for Y chatroom as *consecutive responses*.

Note that both X and Y are optional entities. If the number is omitted, you may assume that it is 1. If the chatroom is omitted, you may assume that it is the latest overall posts across all chatrooms. You do **not** need to handle cases where the number is less than 1, greater than 10, negative, or a floating point number. You **can assume** a user will always either (a) not type a number at all or (b) type in a number between 1 and 10.

### 4. Varied Responses

Go back to each of the previous intents and vary the way in which your agent responds. That is, rather than responding in the same way for each intent, choose from a random verbiage. For example, when a user asks for help, the agent can respond with "In BadgerChat, you can..." or "Try out using..." For each intent, have atleast 2 different ways the agent can respond.

### Submission Details

There is no video demo for this assignment; simply leave your `CS571_WITAI_ACCESS_TOKEN` hardcoded. *This was given for you.*

Then add, commit, and push your code!
